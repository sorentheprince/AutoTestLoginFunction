## Overview

This project is a Java-based automated testing solution using Selenium WebDriver, designed to thoroughly test the login functionality of the SauceDemo website. The testing encompasses two primary scenarios: successful login and logout, as well as the handling of login attempts with locked-out user accounts.

### Key Features

- **Scenario 1: Successful Login and Logout**
  - Demonstrates a seamless login experience using standard user credentials.
  - Validates successful navigation to the home page.
  - Gracefully logs out and confirms the return to the login page.

- **Scenario 2: Handling Locked-Out User Accounts**
  - Handles login attempts with locked-out user credentials.
  - Verifies the presentation of a user-friendly error message.
